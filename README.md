Python Mood Game

This game is a simple Python game. Using ``` mood = input("How is your day so far") ``` We can ask the user for a mood. The program only covers certain moods as it is still in Version 1.0. Another part that is added into the code is ``` import webbrowser ``` which allows for ``` URL's ``` to be opened just like in ```` HTML ````
